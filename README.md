# Folklore
This project is built for [HackCamp 2021](https://hackcamp2021.devpost.com/) hackathon.

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by UBC's confession page on instagram, where people share their stories anonymously. The story can be very funny or just share what they feel at the moment.

## What it does
This project is built for people who want to share their feelings about specific topics and seek a sense of identity among people who have the same feeling. This allows people to share the joys and release pressure and stress by writing out the secret hiding down in everyone's heat. It can show the most trending topics within 7 days, and users can like a topic and add their own story related to this topic. Users can also pull a random story within that topic.

## How we built it
We use HTML, CSS and React.js for the frontend, Node.js, Express.js for the backend, and MySQL for the database

## Challenges we ran into
All of us are beginners for building a website, and 12 hours time window is quite limited for building a fully functional website from scratch.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though this project is not fully complete, we have completed the backend and almost completed the frontend. And the using new tech stack is very exciting

## What we learned
MERN tech stack. Even though we used MySQL for the database as the backend group members are more familiar with MySQL, we plan to change the database to MongoDB in the future

## What's next for Folklore
Complete what is left, and deploy this website online using Heroku
